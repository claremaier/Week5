#Topic modeling notes, command lines, observations

**Using RStudio in DH Box**

*not really clear on what the commands we are entering following the tutorial are, but they seem to be working well.*

What I really like about it is the ability to count frequency/topics by year
**Useful in categorizing papers I downloaded by year** - did something important happen that year? _ use closer, other models to delve into it more deeply**

#Important Points
-Always ask yourself - Is this interesting trend/thing an artefact of the data, or a result of our data collection methods
-Think critically about the analysis -- devote final paper notes to this

#Stuck
I have gotten to this point
"mallet.top.words(topic.model, topic.words[7,])"
Although I don't really understand the technicalities of how I got here and what is going wrong.
RStudio returns this error: 
Error in .jcall("RJavaTools", "Ljava/lang/Object;", "invokeMethod", cl,  : 
  java.lang.NullPointerException
