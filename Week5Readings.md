#Explicit discussion about work of following scholars
**explicit connections with things you've read/explored/studied/developed in other history classes**

*What would your last essay looked like, if you'd been thinking along these lines?*

#Mapping Histories Project
-combining possibilities of text-mining with geospatial mapping
-find meaningful language patterns in massive newspaper collections
*as databases increase in size, typical searches become useless*
-text-mining - find and quantify meaningful language patterns
-visualization - visualizing relationships in various ways
*would have been useful to do this when I was looking at how KW responded to the 1919 Spanish Flu epidemic - think of possibilities*
*it's a process - try something, go back and retrieve info to try that, then move forward and back - noting interesting or significant things along the way*
-need for data transparency (does the search indicate that the term is used a lot in general, or just in the sample?)
-discuss the quality of the data available and any clean-up methods
*would have been interesting to do this for class too*
-with OCR, still have to clean up messy or inaccurate renderings
*importance of spot-checking in any case*
-index collection in different ways - think about this beforehand
*inSpanish Flu, could have compared how the reporting was done by each paper*
-digital historians have to be familiar with mapping conventions or they could produce 
interesting data that makes no sense to others
**use of the annotation layer is extremely interesting and something that should become common in history**
*note difficulties with the data tool - over-representation, bias*
-look for patterns - time periods, words, dates, people, geographies
*use the tools created by others - modify them, contact them to ask what worked or didn't, etc*
*instead of chosing a narrow focus and exploring it - this digital method allows many topics to be layered on top of each other and interact to form a more nuanced picture*

#Corpus Linguistics for Historians


#Visualizing Gender in History of Woman Suffrage


#Podcast: Micki Kaufman on Quantifying Kissinger


#Force-Directed Diagram: Memcons and Telcons "Textplot"


#Network Analysis - Culturomics 2: The Search for More Money
-be aware of the methods you use and what they mean - drawbacks
-are the assumptions going into it about connections, frequency, etc valid?


#Using Metadata to Find Paul Revere
-**presents the analysis as if he is living in 1800s, using old words and referring to modern techniques of searching for people/organizing data**
-try to connect names to show who belongs to the same groups - without explicitly searching through one specific network
*cross tabs - useful for tracking how the flu spread*
-e.g. - person who bridges and is connected to several groups is important to national security (or tells us many other things) - Paul Revere - so a close analysis would confirm this


#When you have a MALLET, everything looks like a nail
Basic concerns for the author:
"The ease of use for LDA with basic settings means humanists are too likely to take its results as 'magic', rather than interpreting it as the output of one clustering technique among many."
"he primary way of evaluating its result (confirming that the top words and texts in each topic 'make sense') ignores most of the model output and doesn't map perfectly onto the expectations we have for the topics."
-linguist meaning can't be firmly reduced to two-dimensional space
-it matters the size of data being clustered and back to methdology
	-remember, have to double-check, cause it's not always right


#Principles of Information Visualization
-"Visualization is a method of deforming, compressing, or otherwise manipulating data in order to see it in new and enlightening ways."
-search for word frequency/where things cluster - ask why?
-Useful for exploration - getting to understand a topic, see missing data, trends, outliers
-Communication - translating complex data relationships in easy to understand way
-information visualization - mapping of abstract data to graphic variables in order to make a visual representation
-scientific visualization - maintains a specific spatial reference system
-infographic - combniation embedded in explicit narrative, with text
-static or dynamic visualizations or interactive 
-Statistical Charts and Time Series (discussion of different types of standard graphs and their purposes)
-Maps (again, types and uses) - creating maps from historical documents is careful and precise work
-Hierarchies and Trees - nested data
-Networks and Matrices - can be complex, difficult to read as they get bigger
**DID NOT DO A CLOSE READING OF THIS TEXT - FOR TOOL-SPECIFIC INFO, RE-READ**
-Small Multiples and Sparklines
**"A visualization is a decision you make based on what you want your audience to learn"**

Visual Encoding
-include colour, shape or position are just as important as what is being visualized
-Scales of Measure (nominal, relational, ordinal, interval, ratio)

Graphic Variable Types
-"visual elements that are used to systematically represent information in a visualization"

Cognitive and Social Apects of Visualization
-colours, culture, gender - audience influence choice of colour palette
-Gestalt psychology (proximity, similarity, closure)
-pre-attentive processing
-change blindness

Making an Effective Visualization
-choosing the data to go into a visualization
-pick a general form
-select appropriate visual encoding
-follow proper aesthetic design principles
	-high resolution, legends, avoid chartjunk (pretty, but distracting formatting)


#Topic Modeling with Newspaper Archives
**Good summary of Topic Models to refer to**
-can create word probability distribution or topic probability
-select and gather data - prepare data - use models to find patterns - close reading to understand patterns
*Questions* **methodology**
-what data was used as input (where from)?
-how was the data prepared for use?
-which software was used?
-what parameters were used for modelling?
-how do these aspects affect interpretation of the models and their application?

Mallet uses LDA - Latent Dirichlet Allocation


#Edward Tufte
-born March 14, 1942 - American statistician
-inforamtion design - pioneer in field of data visualization
-in March 2010, appointed to American Recovery and Reinvestment Acts's Recovery Independent Advisory Panel by Pres. Obama
*chartjunk* - useless, non-informative or information-obscuring elements of quantitative information displays
-also lie factor, data-ink ratio, data density, small multiple, sparklines
-criticizes way Microsoft PowerPoint typically used

#Revealing Sentiment and Plot Arcs with the Syuzhet Package
-extract sentiment and plot information from prose
-organization of the narrative vs. raw elements of story
-manner in which the author presents the events
-how to compare, mathematically and computationally, the shape of one story to another
*lots of reference to Kurt Vonnegut*

#Anglophile in Academia: Annie Swafford's Blog: Problems with the Syuzhet Package
-split novel into sentences
-sentiment analysis to assign positive or negative number to each sentence
-graph it to show emotional rises and falls
-but words are graphed in isolation and "not" therefore has no effect
-contain contemporary words - *olde* words won't be assigned a score
-no nuance - (-1, 0, 1), so "happy" and "very happy" are the same
**need to really understand how the technology works, not just blindly assume that it does**
